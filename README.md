🔌 AI Integration (How it works)

SigmaGPT uses Puter.js to call AI models directly from the browser:

window.puter.ai.chat(prompt)


Your text is securely sent to Puter’s cloud, processed by large language models
(GPT/Llama-class), and the generated response is returned to the app — without API keys or backend cost.
